# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions to advent of code, figured i'd share since everyone else seems to be doing it.
Do not expect me to update this every day, finals are coming up soon.

## Structure
Put your inputs in a file named `{day_number}.txt` in the **Inputs** folder. Then just run the respective day file in the **Days** folder.

### Example: Day 4
Inputs: `Inputs/4.txt`

Part 1 Solution: `Days/4-1.py`

Part 2 Solution: `Days/4-2.py`

## How do I run it
To run just run the respective solution file.

### There's a bug
This is only tested on my machine using pycharm and my inputs and the example in the problem. Send me your inputs and I may have the time to fix it.

*Note: For day 2 I overwrote the part 1 solutions with its part 2 solutions. Maybe I'll bring it back if people actually care.*
